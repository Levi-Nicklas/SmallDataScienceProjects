# Small Data Science / Coding Projects
Repository for my small Data Science / Coding Projects.
These projects are going to be short projects which I spend a few hours on, usually 
just to satisfy a personal curiosity.

In this repo you will find:

- Analysis of Walt Disney World wait times.

- Chincoteague man made oyster reef success on recruitment. 

- Generate all the idempotent elements of 2x2 matricies whose elements are in Z mod 6.

- Analysis, visualization, and modeling of LeBron James and Michael Jordan's careers. 

- NBA 2014-2015 Season Shot Visualizations
    
- ...hopefully more soon!
