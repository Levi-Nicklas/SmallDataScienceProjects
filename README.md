# Small Data Science Projects
Repository for my small Data Science Projects.
These projects are going to be short projects which I spend a few hours on, usually 
just to satisfy a personal curiosity.

In this repo you will find:

- Analysis of Walt Disney World wait times.

- Chincoteague man made oyster reef success on recruitment. 
    
- ...hopefully more soon!
