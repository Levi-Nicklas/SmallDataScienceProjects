# SmallDataScienceProjects
Repository for my small Data Science Projects.
These projects are going to be short projects which I spend a few hours on, usually 
just to satisfy a personal curiosity.

In this repo you will find:
    - Analysis of Walt Disney World wait times.
    - ...hopefully more soon!
