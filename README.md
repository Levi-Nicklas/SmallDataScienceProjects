# Small Data Science / Coding Projects
Repository for my small Data Science / Coding Projects.
These projects are going to be short projects which I spend a few hours on, usually 
just to satisfy a personal curiosity.

In this repo you will find:

- Analysis of Walt Disney World wait times.

- Chincoteague man made oyster reef success on recruitment. 

- Generate all the idempotent elements of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? 2 \cross 2 matricies whose elements are in Z_{6}" /> 
    
- ...hopefully more soon!
